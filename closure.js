// PRIVATE VARIABLES

        return `${name} ${score}`

console.log(hockeyGame()) // Hockey 2

const soccerGame = createGame('Soccer');
console.log(soccerGame()) // Soccer 1
console.log(soccerGame()) // Soccer 2

// Even though the score variable üëÜ is the same variable name, 
// because we have created two separate win() functions by using the createGame() function, 
// they each have their own private variable score.
// Currently there is no way for us to access score.
// If you try to access it in the console, you will get an error

// Closures are the ability of a child function, or an inner function, 
// to access variables from a higher level scope even after the functions 
// have been called or closed or closed over.



// ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê CLOSURE EXPLAINED IN ANOTHER WAY ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

// CLOSURE is a function with preserved data.
// gives you access to an outer function scope from an inner function
// BENEFITS OF CLOSUE:
// State of variables in outer scope are 'saved'
// Variables in outer scopre are considered 'private'

// as an example, lets pretent we are playing a game.

// global varaibale
let points = 0;

// function stored in a variable called 'score'
let score = function(){

    return points += 1
}

// so increament our points, we just need to invoke score
console.log(score()) // 1
console.log(score()) // 2
console.log(score()) // 3

// but there is a problem with this way. Since 'points' is a global variable, 
// someobody writing malicious code can actually change it.
